How to stay safe online

1. Never trust anyone online unless you know them properly.

2. Keep your life to yourself; don't reveal anything that people can track.

3. Still enjoy yourself; don't get paranoid over all of this as it will probably never happen.

4. Only share pictures {if necessary} to people you trust and know.

5. Don't accept any friend requests unless you know them.
